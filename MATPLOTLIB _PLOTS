📈 1. Line Plot
Definition: Displays data points connected by straight lines.

Use Case: Best for showing trends over time (e.g., stock prices, temperature changes).

📊 2. Bar Chart (Vertical & Horizontal)
Definition: Represents categorical data with rectangular bars.

Vertical Bar Chart: Bars rise upwards from the x-axis.

Horizontal Bar Chart: Bars extend sideways from the y-axis.

Use Case: Comparing different categories or groups (e.g., sales by product).

🥧 3. Pie Chart
Definition: Circular chart divided into slices to show proportions of a whole.

Use Case: Representing percentage distribution of categories (e.g., market share).

📊 4. Histogram
Definition: A type of bar chart that shows the frequency distribution of numerical data.

Use Case: Analyzing the distribution and spread (e.g., exam scores, ages).

🔵 5. Scatter Plot
Definition: Uses dots to represent values for two numeric variables.

Use Case: Identifying relationships or correlations between two variables (e.g., height vs weight).

📦 6. Box Plot (Box-and-Whisker Plot)
Definition: Summarizes the distribution of data using quartiles and highlights outliers.

Use Case: Comparing data spread and spotting outliers (e.g., test scores across classes).

📉 7. Area Chart
Definition: Like a line plot, but the area under the line is filled with color.

Use Case: Showing cumulative data trends over time (e.g., website traffic).

📚 8. Stack Plot (Stacked Area Chart)
Definition: An area chart that displays multiple datasets stacked on top of each other.

Use Case: Visualizing part-to-whole relationships over time (e.g., resource usage).

🗂️ 9. Subplots and Grid Layouts
Definition: Multiple plots arranged in a grid within a single figure.

Use Case: Comparing different datasets or visualizations side-by-side.
